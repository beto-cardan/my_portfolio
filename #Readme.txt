#Project my Personal site

#Theme Selection: I began by choosing a theme for my portfolio website. After some consideration, I decided on a dark, orange, and white color scheme to give it a modern and vibrant feel.

#Layout and Element Decision: Next, I outlined the layout and key elements of the website. I wanted it to be intuitive and easy to navigate, so I included sections like Portfolio, Home, About, Works, and Contact.

#Header Creation: I started by creating a header that would be consistent across all pages. It prominently featured the main sections of the website, making it simple for visitors to find what they're looking for.

#First Section - Introduction: In the first section, I wanted to introduce myself and my role as a FrontEnd Developer. I added a button in a striking orange color to draw attention to the statement "I am a FrontEnd Developer," set against the background of my picture.

#Second Section - Presentation: Moving on to the second section, I divided it into two parts. On the left side, I placed a photo of myself, while on the right side, I provided a brief introduction about who I am and listed my skills.

#Third Section - Portfolio: The third section showcased my works. I added a second header with the names of my projects and linked them for easy access. Below, I created a grid layout displaying photos of programming languages and projects, organized neatly into rows and columns.

#Favicon Creation: To personalize my website further, I designed a favicon that would appear in the browser tab. It's a small detail, but it adds a professional touch to the overall presentation.

#Card Creation: Finally, I wanted to create visually appealing cards to highlight key information or projects. I used Canva to design these cards, ensuring they were eye-catching and informative.
